Requirements for Final:
 Minimum of 5 html pages
 At least one form, with each field verified.
 Use at least 5 instances of JavaScript
 At least one jQuery effect
 All JavaScript should be external
 Use only external CSS
 DO NOT re-use assignments or projects from this or previous courses. All work must be original.
You must have at least one menu on each page which makes the site navigation seamless: no shifting when navigating between pages, therefore the main menu must be located in same position on each html page.
